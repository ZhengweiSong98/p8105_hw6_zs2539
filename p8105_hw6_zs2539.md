## Problem 2

## Importing the dataset

``` r
homicide_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

#### Creating a `city_state` variable, binary variable `resolution` indicating case disposition, omitting cities excluded victim race and Tulsa, AL with data entry mistake. Also, limiting `victim_race` is white or black, making `victim_age` numeric.

``` r
homicide_df = homicide_raw %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(
        reported_date = as.Date(as.character(reported_date), format = "%Y%m%d"),
        city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
        victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
        resolution = case_when(
            disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
            disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
            disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
    )) %>%
    relocate(city_state) %>%
    filter(city_state != c("Tulsa, AL","Dallas, TX","Phoenix, AZ","Kansas City, MO"),
           victim_race == c("White","Black"))
```
